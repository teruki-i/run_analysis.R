This is my code for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project

This code uses data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The original study collected data from 30 subjects walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying and took various measures of their motions.

This code takes the raw data from this study, creates a tidy data set, and saves the tidy data set into a txt file
The tidy data set includes the averages of the means and standard deviation of the measures for each motion for each subject
